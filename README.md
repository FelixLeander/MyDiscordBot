# WORK IN PROGRESS

## Hi there
This is my perosnal project of a Discord-Bot.
It is NOT intended as an actual good Bot for Discord, but more so as a personal excersie.
Simply said; I want to add as much mid-large featrues into it, as I can.

### The reason?
#### For the lols!

##### But honestly; I just want to have a larger program to work on;
#### Testing my personal limits with programming and IT in general.

> Finding limits with programming and ur using C#? Lamo.
Yes, it's funny; that's why I'm making it HIALRIOUS by doing some extra work:
- Fixing ANY (if it remotly makes sense) Issues & Pull Requests etc., made on GitHub to this project (my friends will love this).
- Keeping the coding guidlines from my current company (I'm already breaking them... very on brand, jk).
- As mentioned; put LOTS of features into it.
	1. Downloading Media from YT and adding them as on demand clips.
	2. Soundboard with web-interface wtih file (WIP), YouTube upload.
	3. [Something uncommited for now, gonna be a suprise for some friends].
	4. Tag based access (and some prebuilds) to access images of an imageBoard website.
- Keeping up with CURRENT best practices of the C#/DOTNET practices.
### Now the *truly fun* parts!
- Keeping the project cross platfrom (Linux/Windows).
- Fully orchestrated (Sry Windows, but your a real (female dog, slur) with this).
- Full CI/CD; rolling release style (I still can't belive how suprisingly easy this was).
	1. Project versioned with GIT.
	2. Hosting repository on GitHub & Forgejo (self-hosted & private).
	3. Containerized with docker.
	4. Running on container on Portainer.

### While some of these were a struggle, combining these was maddening!
#### But making progress and revisiting stuff is a great learning progress.

## Roadmap/ToDo's
- Reworking services into plugins.
- Seperating ASP.NET from the DiscordBot itself.

Well anyway, if you wanna say anything about this, feel free to contact me and start a disscussion <3
